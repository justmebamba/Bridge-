/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict two-tier access model: regular users and administrators.
 * Users have exclusive ownership over their own data within the `/tiktok_users` collection. Administrators,
 * identified by the existence of a document in the `/admins` collection, have privileged access to manage
 * system-wide resources like the list of available phone numbers.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into three distinct top-level collections to segregate user data,
 * administrative data, and shared resources, simplifying security logic.
 * - /tiktok_users/{tiktokUserId}: Contains private user profile data.
 * - /phone_numbers/{phoneNumberId}: A list of phone numbers available to users, managed by admins.
 * - /admins/{adminId}: An access control list where document IDs correspond to the UIDs of admin users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Role Management: A user is considered an admin if their UID matches a document ID in the `/admins`
 *   collection. This provides a simple and secure role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism.
 * - User Data Privacy: Users can only read and write their own document within `/tiktok_users`. Listing
 *   the entire collection is explicitly forbidden to prevent user data enumeration (except for admins).
 * - Publicly Readable, Admin-Managed Resources: The `/phone_numbers` collection is readable by any
 *   signed-in user so they can select a number, but all write operations (create, update, delete) are
 *   restricted to administrators.
 * - Default Deny: Access is implicitly denied unless an explicit `allow` rule grants it.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The primary authorization mechanism is role-based, achieved by using the
 * `/admins` collection as a lookup table. The `isAdmin()` function performs an `exists()` check against this
 * collection. This is highly performant and avoids storing role information on every user document.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: User data (`tiktok_users`), admin role definitions (`admins`), and system resources
 * (`phone_numbers`) are stored in separate top-level collections. This clear separation is fundamental to the
 * security model, ensuring that rules for one type of data do not inadvertently affect another.
